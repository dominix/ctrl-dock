Each user has an entry in the oa_user table.
Each Group has an entry in the oa_group table.
Each system has an entry in the system table.

A group can be determined either statically or dynamically.
A static group is simply a list of manually selected systems.
A dynamic group uses a SQL query to determine the systems that belong to it.

Each system has an entry in oa_group_system noting it's system_id and the group_id from the oa_group table.
Thus, a system can belong to more than one group and one group can have more than one system.

Each user has an entry in oa_group_user noting it's user_id and the group_id from oa_group.
Also stored is the level of access that user has for that group.
0 - no access
3 - view only in "list" type screens
5 - view basic individual system details
7 - view "sensitive" details about a system
10 - edit system details and custom data

So, if a user wishes to view a group, it is first checked that his group_access_level is at least 1.
The user_id is known (cookie). 
The group_id is known (in the url).
If it is, the group is listed as per the details from oa_group.
If it is not (ie - the user has a group_access_level of 0 of null), the user is redirected to the "list all" type page.

The same principle applies to individual systems.
The user_id is known.
The system_id is known.
They are combined and the group_access_level is determined, hence access granted or denied.
The highest group_access_level is used - not the lowest.
Thus, if a system belongs to more than one group, but a user has differing levels of access to those groups, the highest level will be applied and used.
